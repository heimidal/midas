h1. Midas

Midas is an editor much like TinyMCE and FCKEditor, but with a different usage paradigm.  It expects that an entire page is something that can be editable, and allows editable regions to be specified.

The important difference is that it uses the HTML5 contentEditable feature on divs, instead of using iframes, which allows for css to be applied in ways that other editors don't handle.

h2. The Story

I wrote and used a similar editor in the past (written in 2005, and utilized up until now).  It was getting pretty outdated, used iframes for contentEditable, and did some lame hackery to pull css in and apply it to the contents of the editable iframe.  The methodology has some downsides in how the css can be created and managed.

So a lot of things have changed in that time, and it seemed time for a re-write.  I decided to open source it so the community could build on it, and maybe help out if it's successful.  It's fully tested using jasmine and cucumber.

The plan is to build it out to the same, or close to the same level as the other editors.  But until then, it has some features that the other editors don't provide at this point, and lacks some that they do.

For now, it requires Prototype, but after development slows down, there are plans to make it library agnostic.  Midas only supports W3C compatible implementations of the contentEditable spec, which means Gecko and Webkit.  Officially supported browsers are Firefox 3.6+, Safari 4.0+, and Chrome (it would seem all versions).  More support for other browsers will be added over time, in theory, or we could wait until all the browsers support the W3C spec, which is my personal pipe dream.

h2. Installation and Usage

1. Download and install the gem:
@gem install midas@

2. Put the Midas rake tasks into your Rakefile
...

3. Run the following rake tasks based on your needs:
* @rake midas:install@ - to install the entire thing
* @rake midas:install_js@ - to install just the editor and css (no additional tools like image uploading are included)

4. Check that the files are in your project.
* /public/javascripts/midas.js - unminified / packed js
* /public/javascripts/midas.min.js - minified and packed js (configuration is not minified)
* /public/stylesheets/midas.css - unminfied css, with image urls intact
* /public/stylesheets/midas.bundle.css - minified css, with image urls replaced with data urls (no images are nessicary when using this css, which greatly reduces the number of requests)

5. Include the files you want into your layout (or views):
...

6. Add some 'editable' classnames to some divs that you want to be able to edit.

7. Instantiate Midas (at the bottom of the page, in window.onload, or in dom:loaded etc):
<pre>var midas = new Midas();</pre>

h2. Midas Options

The Midas constructer takes three arguments, all objects, in the following manner:

* midas options
* toolbar options
* region options

So, instantiating Midas can be as simple as:

<pre>
  var midas = new Midas();
</pre>

to as advanced as:

<pre>
  var midas = new Midas({
    useIframe: true,
    classname: 'some-editable-classname'
    }, {
    // toolbar options
    }, {
    // region options
    });
</pre>

h3. Supported Options

h2. Midas and Saving

Midas assumes that saves will be "updates", so it uses the RESTful standard POST with the _method parameter set to "put".  It's unlikely that Midas will be used to create pages, so the default save method is considered PUT, however, as outlined above in the Midas Options section you can override this to be a CREATE action by specifying "post" instead.

To save successfully an id attribute is required on any editable element (by default this is any element with the "editable" classname.  The POST comes through with fields the name of the id attribute of the elements that were editable.

h2. Development

The project is basically broken into three parts.. Javascript, the HTML views (palettes, panels etc), and the rake tasks.  To get started run @bundle install@, which will give you all the gems you'll need for testing etc.

h3. Rake Tasks

* @midas:build@ - builds the installable files into the public/distro path

* @midas:minify_js@ - generates midas.js and midas.min.js (configuration doesn't get minified)
* @midas:bundle_css@ - generates midas.css and midas.bundled.css

h3. Javascript

The javascript is broken into several different files in the /public/javascripts/midas path.. midas.js is the controller more or less, and the other files are different aspects of the system.  These get combined into a single file by running @rake midas:build@.  The same is true for the CSS, with the addition that the images are bundled into the CSS using the base64 data url method.

The following four files are generated after running the rake task:

* /public/distro/javascripts/midas.js
* /public/distro/javascripts/midas.min.js
* /public/distro/stylesheets/midas.css
* /public/distro/stylesheets/midas.bundle.css

h4. Testing with Jasmine:
* run @rake jasmine@
* navigate to @http://localhost:8888/@

h4. Testing with Cucumber:
* run @cucumber@

h4. Regression testing (something I often do):
* after runing @rake jasmine:server@ you can navigate to the following urls and confirm things are still in working order:
* @http://localhost:8888/examples/index.html@
* @http://localhost:8888/examples/distro.html@

You can also run @rake jasmine:ci@ if you're using a CI system.
